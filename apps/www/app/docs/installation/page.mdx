# Installation

import { Steps, Callout, Tabs } from "nextra/components";

This guide will help you set up CraftJS and get your AI app running in minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js 20+** - [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **pnpm 9+** - Install with `npm install -g pnpm`
- **PostgreSQL database** - We recommend [Neon](https://neon.tech/) for serverless PostgreSQL

<Callout type="info">
  CraftJS uses pnpm as the package manager for its faster installation and disk
  space efficiency.
</Callout>

## Installation Steps

<Steps>
### Create a New Project

Use the CLI to create a new CraftJS application:

```bash
npx create-craft-app my-ai-app
```

Or with other package managers:

```bash
# With pnpm
pnpm create craft-app my-ai-app

# With yarn
yarn create craft-app my-ai-app

# With bun
bunx create-craft-app my-ai-app
```

The CLI will guide you through the setup process and install all dependencies automatically.

## CLI Options

The `create-craft-app` CLI supports the following options:

| Option           | Description                                   |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `[project-name]` | Name of the project (default: `my-craft-app`) |
| `-y, --yes`      | Skip all prompts and use defaults             |
| `--use-npm`      | Use npm as the package manager                |
| `--use-yarn`     | Use yarn as the package manager               |
| `--use-pnpm`     | Use pnpm as the package manager (recommended) |
| `--use-bun`      | Use bun as the package manager                |

### Interactive Mode

By default, the CLI runs in interactive mode and will prompt you for:

1. **Project name** - What your project will be called
2. **Package manager** - Choose between pnpm (recommended), npm, yarn, or bun
3. **Confirmation** - Review your choices before creating the project

### Non-Interactive Mode

Use the `-y` or `--yes` flag to skip all prompts:

```bash
npx create-craft-app my-app -y --use-pnpm
```

This will install all required dependencies including:

- Next.js 16
- Tailwind CSS v4
- shadcn/ui components
- Better Auth
- Drizzle ORM
- Vercel AI SDK 6
- And more...

### Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and fill in your values. See the [Configuration](/configuration) page for detailed instructions on each variable.

### Set Up the Database

Push the database schema to your PostgreSQL database:

```bash
pnpm db:push
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure your `DATABASE_URL` is correctly set in `.env` before running this
  command.
</Callout>

### Start the Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Your app will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

</Steps>

## Quick Setup with Neon

If you don't have a PostgreSQL database yet, here's how to set one up with Neon:

<Steps>
### Create a Neon Account

Go to [neon.tech](https://neon.tech/) and sign up for a free account.

### Create a New Project

Click "New Project" and give it a name (e.g., "my-ai-app").

### Copy the Connection String

In your project dashboard, find the connection string and copy it.

### Update Your Environment

Add the connection string to your `.env` file:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@ep-xxx.region.aws.neon.tech/dbname?sslmode=require"
```

</Steps>

## Verifying Installation

After starting the development server, you should see:

1. **Landing Page** - A beautiful landing page at `/`
2. **Auth Pages** - Login (`/login`) and Register (`/register`) pages
3. **Dashboard** - Protected dashboard at `/dashboard` (after signing in)
